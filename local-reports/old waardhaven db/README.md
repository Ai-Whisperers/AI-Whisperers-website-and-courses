## 💾 Actual Data Found

### strategy_configs (1 record)
The only table with actual data. Contains a single strategy configuration:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "momentum_weight": null,
  "market_cap_weight": null,
  "risk_parity_weight": null,
  "daily_drop_threshold": null,
  "max_daily_return": null,
  "min_daily_return": null,
  "min_price_threshold": null,
  "rebalance_frequency": null,
  "last_rebalance": null,
  "force_rebalance": null,
  "max_forward_fill_days": null,
  "outlier_std_threshold": null,
  "ai_adjusted": null,
  "ai_adjustment_reason": null,
  "ai_confidence_score": null,
  "created_at": "TIMESTAMP",
  "updated_at": "TIMESTAMP",
  "adjustment_history": null
}
```

**Analysis:** Default/placeholder record with no actual configuration values.

## 🔧 Schema Features

### Database Design Highlights:
- ✅ Foreign key constraints for referential integrity
- ✅ Comprehensive indexes for query performance
- ✅ JSON fields for flexible data storage
- ✅ Timestamp tracking (created_at, updated_at)
- ✅ UUID primary keys for distributed systems
- ✅ Unique constraints on business keys

### Notable Design Patterns:
- Many-to-many relationships (asset_news)
- One-to-one relationships (news_sentiment)
- Hierarchical data (users → portfolios → allocations)
- Event sourcing (sentiment_history)

## 🔄 Restoration Instructions

### If you ever need to restore this database:

#### Option 1: Using Prisma Schema
```bash
# 1. Use the saved Prisma schema
cp local-reports/migration/schema/schema.prisma prisma/schema.prisma

# 2. Create migrations
npx prisma migrate dev --name restore_trading_system

# 3. Restore data (if needed)
# Create a restoration script based on JSON files
```

#### Option 2: Manual SQL Import
```bash
# The schema can be converted to SQL via Prisma
npx prisma migrate diff \
  --from-empty \
  --to-schema-datamodel prisma/schema.prisma \
  --script > restore.sql
```

## 📝 Migration Context

### Why This Database Existed:
This database was provisioned for a financial trading/portfolio management application that was under development. The system was designed to:

1. **Track Assets** - Monitor stocks, ETFs, and other securities
2. **Analyze News** - Aggregate and sentiment-analyze financial news
3. **Generate Signals** - Create trading signals based on patterns
4. **Manage Portfolios** - Track user portfolios and allocations
5. **Monitor Social Media** - Track "meme stock" velocity
6. **Detect Anomalies** - Identify extreme market events

### Why It's Being Replaced:
- Never reached production use
- Only 1 record across 20 tables
- Different application than current LMS needs
- Database needed for AI Whisperers LMS platform
- More cost-effective to reuse existing database

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Data Loss Assessment:
- **Risk Level:** MINIMAL
- **Data Value:** Low (only schema + 1 config record)
- **Recovery Needed:** Unlikely
- **Schema Preservation:** Complete backup exists

### Schema Complexity:
- **Total Tables:** 20
- **Total Relationships:** ~15 foreign keys
- **Indexes:** ~40 indexes
- **Constraints:** ~10 unique constraints

This was a well-designed system that simply never got populated with data.

> Evaluate why are these enviroment variables important (I mean they are optional but where do they influence on the codebase? What do they allow us to do If properly configured)        
Answer on two paragraphs. The env variables are: GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET

GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID
OPENAI_API_KEY
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
CONVERTKIT_API_KEY 

‚óè GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET and GITHUB_CLIENT_ID/SECRET enable OAuth authentication providers in your NextAuth configuration (src/lib/auth/config.ts). The buildProviders() function
  dynamically checks for these credentials and only activates the corresponding authentication methods if they're present - without at least one OAuth provider configured, users
  cannot sign in to the platform at all. Google OAuth is recommended as the primary authentication method since it's widely adopted and trusted, while GitHub OAuth serves as an
  alternative for developer-focused users. These credentials allow NextAuth to securely redirect users to Google/GitHub for authentication, receive authorization codes, and
  create/manage user sessions in your PostgreSQL database, which is essential for the entire LMS platform since course enrollment, progress tracking, and user accounts all depend on
  authenticated sessions.

  GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID enables user behavior tracking, conversion analytics, and traffic insights for data-driven decision making about course offerings and user experience
  improvements. OPENAI_API_KEY and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY are reserved for future AI-powered features like intelligent course recommendations, automated content generation, AI tutoring
  assistance, or natural language interaction with course materials - these would differentiate your LMS as an "AI Whisperers" platform with actual AI integration beyond just
  teaching about AI. CONVERTKIT_API_KEY enables email marketing automation for newsletter signups, course announcements, drip campaigns for student engagement, and automated
  onboarding sequences - critical for user retention and marketing. While these are optional now, they represent the scalability path from MVP to a fully-featured educational
  platform with analytics-driven optimization, AI-enhanced learning experiences, and automated student engagement.

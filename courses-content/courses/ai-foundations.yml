          Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by
          machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition
          of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach
          approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction.

          In this lesson, we'll explore:
          - The definition and scope of AI
          - Different types of AI (Narrow AI vs General AI)
          - Real-world applications across industries
          - The difference between AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning

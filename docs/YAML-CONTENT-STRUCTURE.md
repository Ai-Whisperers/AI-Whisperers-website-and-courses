# YAML Content Structure Guide

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-02
**Purpose:** Standardized YAML content structure for AI Whisperers website

---

## üéØ Overview

This document defines the correct YAML content structure for all page content files. Following these standards ensures:
- Type safety and TypeScript compatibility
- Consistent component rendering
- No runtime type casting (`as any`)
- Predictable content behavior

---

## üìã General Principles

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Use **objects with `title` property** for sections with headers
- Use **arrays of objects** for lists with nested properties
- Include all required fields from type definitions (`src/types/content.ts`)
- Match property names exactly to TypeScript interfaces

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Use flat arrays for complex structures
- Mix array and object structures for the same content type
- Use `content` when types expect `description`
- Skip required nested properties

---

## üìÑ Page-Specific Structures

    description: "We maintain the highest standards"

# ‚ùå WRONG: Flat array instead of object with title + members
team:
  - name: "Name 1"
    role: "Lead AI Instructor"

# ‚ùå WRONG: Using 'content' instead of 'description' for mission/vision
mission:
  title: "Our Mission"
  content: |  # Should be 'description'
    Our mission text...

# ‚ùå WRONG: Stats without title and proper structure
stats:
  coursesOffered: "Multiple Levels"  # Should use metrics array

## üîç Type Reference

All structures must match TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/content.ts`:

### Key Type Mappings

| YAML Section | TypeScript Interface | Required Properties |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| `hero` | `Hero` | headline, subheadline, description, location, primaryCta, secondaryCta, benefits |
| `values` | `{ title: string, items: FeatureItem[] }` | title, items (each with icon, title, description) |
| `team` | `{ title: string, members: Array<...> }` | title, members (each with name, role, bio, expertise, image) |
| `stats` | `Stats` | title, description, metrics (or company for compatibility) |
| `contact` | `Contact` | title, description, primaryCta, secondaryCta, info |
| `mission/vision` | `{ title: string, description: string }` | title, **description** (NOT content) |
